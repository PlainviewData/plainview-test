    "story": "Trump said that he hates baboons. This is a continuation of a long line of hate. The revelation became apparent this Friday morning when in a press conference, Trump announced his disdain for the species: 'They are awful creatures, just awful.' Although the crowd to which he was speaking cheered, it marks a continuation in the hateful rhetoric the President has been known to use. Jonathan O'Riley, a baboon scientist and enthusiast, commented, 'This is dissapointing to hear from our President. Baboons are wonderful, magnificent creatures that need our attention.'",

Well, after falling into the trap hundreds of times myself, I've compiled the top 5 reasons why we read top 5 lists. 1. We are lazy 2. We like bite size information because our attention spans are low. 3. We don't have anything else to do while our professor or boss is talking. 4. Someone shared a status alongside the post and we want to know if it lives up to the hype. 5. We deny our inability to not look at a screen for 5 minutes.",
